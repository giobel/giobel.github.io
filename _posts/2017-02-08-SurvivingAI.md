title: SURVIVING AI - Calum Chace
layout: post

AI: 
- bulk process data
- lots of data
- find patterns

- The most obvious manifestation of AI today are our smartphones.
- We are highly social animals
- We don’t know whether technological unemployment will be the result of the automation of jobs by AI, or whether humans will find new jobs in the way we have done since the start of the industrial revolution. 
- The range of possible outcomes is wide and not pre-determined:
 They will be selected partly by luck, partly by their own internal logic, but partly also by the policies embraced at all levels of society.
 - be as flexible as possible to meet the challenges of a fast-changing world.
 - Automation and superintelligence are the two main forces 
 - Automation could lead to an economic singularity:
 might lead to an elite owning the means of production and suppressing the rest of us in a dystopian technological authoritarian regime.
 Or it could lead to an economy of radical abundance
 The arrival of superintelligence, if and when it happens, would represent a technological singularity 
 Death could become optional 
 If we get it wrong it could spell extinction.
 
 # Artificial Narrow Intelligence
 
- Intelligence: ability to acquire information, and use it to achieve a goal. 
- Marcus Hutter and Shane Legg, a co-founder of a company called DeepMind: “intelligence measures an agent’s general ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.”
- Howard Gardner (American psychologist) has distinguished 9 types of intelligence: linguistic, logic-mathematical, musical, spatial, bodily, interpersonal, intrapersonal, existential and naturalistic.

**Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by a machine or by software.**

Two very different types of artificial intelligence: 
- artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) or **weak AI** or ordinary AI: 
    - computers which can play chess better than the best human chess grandmaster 
    - no computer can yet beat humans at every intellectual endeavour.
    - simply does what we tell it to
- artificial general intelligence (AGI)  or **strong AI** or full AI.
    - can carry out any cognitive function that a human can
    - has the ability to reflect on its goals and decide whether to adjust them
    - it will have volition
    - probably will need to have self-awareness and be conscious
    - some people prefer the term “machine intelligence”
