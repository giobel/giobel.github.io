Thinking in Java 3rd edition

## Chapter 4

- Many C bugs occur when the programmer forgets to initialize a variable.
- Java has: 
  - Constructor: a special method automatically called when an object is created
  - Garbage Collector: automatically release memory
- if a class has a constructor -> Java automatically calls that constructor *when an object is created*
- the name of the constructor is the same as the name of the class
