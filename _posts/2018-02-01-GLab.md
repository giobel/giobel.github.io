## 1. The basic elements: trunk and crown
Before diving into Dynamo we need to have a clear idea of each step required to build the final geometry. Looking at the image below we can immediately subdivide the structure in two parts: the column (trunk) and the crown. 
We can also notice that the structure is symmetric. This mean that we only need to create one column and a quarter of the crown to generate the rest.
### The geometry of the trunk
The trunk can be represented by an arc by three points.
The trunk is connected to the crown in two points and has one secondary branch.
### The geometry of the crown
The crown is a square divided in 4 quadrants by 8 beams forming a star on plan. These beams are connected at the midpoint of the 4 arches forming the edge of the crown. Four additional arches (ribs) connect the edge corners to the centre of the crown.
