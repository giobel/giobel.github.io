Richard Susskind:

## Two waves of AI:
## 1. 1986-1988: decision tree system

Failed because:
- costly
- little incentive to adopt (pay by the hour)
- the invention of the web (lots of documents available at no costs)

To make a computer do clever things:

1. find how human beings do clever things

2. draw decision trees or procedures that captured the human beings reasoning processes

3. put them into a computer systems

The intelligence was more in the representation that the human beings put together than the system
Human expert relies in tacit knowledge, that cannot be expressed in rules
Machine are great for doing complex but routine work that you can reduce to a set of procedures but when you need expertise, experience and creativity you could not reduce that to a set of procedures so that for all time will be for humans to do.

## 2. 1997 Deep Blue beat Gary Kasparov: till then has been thought it was impossible.

- We did not predicted the exponential increase of processing power (Deep Blue 300 million moves in 1 second)
- Kasparov was not beaten by some creative imaginative innovative systems.
- He was beaten by:
    1. brute processing power
    2. huge amounts of past data
    3. clever algorithms
This in the long run is what is going to replace almost all white collar workers.

AI Fallacy: the only way a machine could perform at the level of human experts was by replicating their expertise or judgement. 
The system does not know anything about the data it is processing. 
No one is thinking to create a robot that replicates what humans do.

- The most obvious manifestation of AI today are our smartphones.
- We are highly social animals
- We don’t know whether technological unemployment will be the result of the automation of jobs by AI, or whether humans will find new jobs in the way we have done since the start of the industrial revolution. 
- The range of possible outcomes is wide and not pre-determined:
 They will be selected partly by luck, partly by their own internal logic, but partly also by the policies embraced at all levels of society.
 - be as flexible as possible to meet the challenges of a fast-changing world.
 - Automation and superintelligence are the two main forces 
 - Automation could lead to an economic singularity:
 might lead to an elite owning the means of production and suppressing the rest of us in a dystopian technological authoritarian regime.
 Or it could lead to an economy of radical abundance
 The arrival of superintelligence, if and when it happens, would represent a technological singularity 
 Death could become optional 
 If we get it wrong it could spell extinction.
 
 # Artificial Narrow Intelligence
 
- Intelligence: ability to acquire information, and use it to achieve a goal. 
- Marcus Hutter and Shane Legg, a co-founder of a company called DeepMind: “intelligence measures an agent’s general ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.”
- Howard Gardner (American psychologist) has distinguished 9 types of intelligence: linguistic, logic-mathematical, musical, spatial, bodily, interpersonal, intrapersonal, existential and naturalistic.

**Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by a machine or by software.**

Two very different types of artificial intelligence: 
- artificial narrow intelligence (ANI) or **weak AI** or ordinary AI: 
    - computers which can play chess better than the best human chess grandmaster 
    - no computer can yet beat humans at every intellectual endeavour.
    - simply does what we tell it to
- artificial general intelligence (AGI)  or **strong AI** or full AI.
    - can carry out any cognitive function that a human can
    - has the ability to reflect on its goals and decide whether to adjust them
    - it will have volition
    - probably will need to have self-awareness and be conscious
    - some people prefer the term “machine intelligence”
