Solutions have been out there for a while now, the skillsets to grab them are spreading now and visual programming like Dynamo and Grasshopper have definitely contributed to.

# What ~~tools~~ risks?

- Small programs that can be built in less than a week by a one person
- They do one very specific thing for one specific project
- They can automate repetitive tasks or make Revit smarter
- They can provide new feature or piggyback existing ones
- They are not meant to be uploaded on the Tool Register but they live on GitLab:
    - Not meant to be deployed globally
    - Can be accessed by anyone who want to reuse part of the code
    - Implements version control
    - Colleagues can update and improve the code
- They are used by a limited and small number of users:
    - Easier to train on how to use the tool
    - Immediate feedback for usability and bugs
- Let's ignore IP for simplicity


# Examples: New tool

## Void By Face
<video id="pelican-installation" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls preload="auto" width="720" height="550" data-setup="{}">
<source src="/videos/VoidByLine.mp4" type='video/mp4'></video>

1716 Rectangular + 1312 Circular = 3028 â†’ 554mb

## Void By Line
<video id="pelican-installation" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls preload="auto" width="720" height="550" data-setup="{}">
<source src="/videos/VoidByFace.mp4" type='video/mp4'></video>

## Add Metadata to PDF + Viewer
<video id="pelican-installation" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls preload="auto" width="720" height="550" data-setup="{}">
<source src="/videos/MetadataViewer.mp4" type='video/mp4'></video>

# Examples: Add function to existing one

## BCFier batch issues
<video id="pelican-installation" class="video-js vjs-default-skin" controls preload="auto" width="720" height="550" data-setup="{}">
<source src="/videos/BCFierBatch.mp4" type='video/mp4'></video>

## Print Selected PDFs

# Could have they been created with Dynamo?

- Yes:
    - Revit Voids (Dynamo script by Ethan Gear)
    - Print Selected PDFs
- No:
    - Pdf Metadata
    - BCFier

When another software is involved, Dynamo is not enough.

Also:

- *Dynamo is Dead* cit. Konrad Sobon

- It's not as fast as a macro or C# addin
- Easier to share few lines of code than a custom node
- Dynamo never ending version compatibility issues

## Problems

- Inevitably buggy (because done in a hurry and not by Software Developers)
- Someone in each office should be in charge of creation and deployment
- Set up personalised toolbars
- What started as a simple tool with 2 buttons becomes a hell
