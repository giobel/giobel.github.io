## Using functions and classes to simplify iterations and organize data in objects instead of lists.

Example 1: Find beam closest Grids







Context: Check that the openings in a beam are consistent with a typical detail

<img src="/images/class01.PNG" width="900" style="display:block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

To check the openings we will need a list including the opening width and depth, its centroid, the beam height, the beam start and end point.

This can be achieved through a nested for loop:

```python

```
